<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Sahil Kumar. I’m a dedicated professional with over six years of experience in data sourcing, PDF analysis, and donor information extraction at VeriGift. I specialize in identifying NGOs and organizations, analyzing their reports, and maintaining clean, categorized datasets. Alongside my work, I also train new employees and help improve data processes for efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>I began working right after finishing my 12th in 2016 and have grown through consistent learning and discipline. My work hours are from 3 PM to 12 AM, which gives me flexibility to manage personal learning goals. I’m currently self-studying programming to become a full-stack developer and eventually transition into the tech field full-time. My dream is to build tools that make data work easier, faster, and more intelligent.</p>

<p>Outside work, I focus on health and fitness — rebuilding my strength after weight gain during the lockdown. I enjoy park workouts, reading Xianxia novels, and watching reaction videos and vlogs to relax. I believe discipline and curiosity can take anyone far, regardless of where they start. My guiding principle is simple: freedom to grow, learn, and choose your own path in life.</p>
